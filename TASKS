pi:
- look into how we can login as pi without x session

deploy:
- copy .xinitrc and other home files -> rpi-deploy repo
- could do with override settings files
- setup proxy
- pretty sure we changed some x config files for the screen blanking
- install matchbox window manager package
- create alternate user, key only
- disable ssh for pi user
- disable password logon for ssh
- java oracle 8
